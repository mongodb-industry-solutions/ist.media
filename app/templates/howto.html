                        The purpose of this demo is to show how easily a sophisticated, personalized
                        newspaper experience can be built by leveraging the best features of MongoDB
                        and generative AI (GenAI) to deliver multimodal content across multichannel
                        platforms.

                        How to use the demo
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        There are several paths you can follow to conduct your demo. Combine them as
                        you see fit for your meeting with the customer, aligning to their
                        requirements:
                    </p>
                    <p><ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Document Model</strong>: In the Single Post Page, you can
                                click on the article's title to open a browser window which displays
                                the MongoDB Document in a nice, colored fashion. Use this to
                                discuss how to build 360 degree object structures, in this case a
                                document which is capable of storing all of the article's main content
                                fields (id, title, body, date, imageURL),
                                calculated meta data (e.g. read count),
                                generated fields with the help of GenAI (e.g. keywords, sentiment) as well as
                                embeddings for semantic/vector search.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Hybrid Search</strong>: Use the form at the top of the Home
                                or Single Post page to enter what you are interested about. It can
                                be keyword-based ("Apple AI"), or a full phrase ("what are the
                                recent notable events around Lucid Group"). In the search results,
                                you find some meta information below each item. It is the individual
                                scores of the Full Text and Vector searches, as well as the Time
                                Decay factor (the older the article, the lower the number). Explain
                                to your customer how easily developers can implement such a
                                sophisticated parallel search. You can
                                use <a class="tm-color-primary" href="#hybridsearch">this
                                picture</a> for more technical audiences.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Multimodal Video Search</strong>: On the left main
                                navigation, click Video Search (accessible from the Home page).
                                You can search for something displayed in the video ("basketball"),
                                including written text ("Ted Lasso", "the feeling of joy"),
                                and for words/sentences spoken on the voice track ("car play ultra").
                                One of two videos will be selected, and they start playing with an
                                appropriate offset to immediately see the sequence in question.
                                To make your life easier, there's a list of preconfigured search
                                terms at the bottom of the page for you to click.
                                This capability of the demo is powered by
                                <a href="https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/multimodal-embeddings"
                                   class="tm-color-primary">

                                </a>
                                of Voyage AI.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Content Suggestions / Related Posts</strong>: Click on a
                                news article on the Home page. Show the right column of the page,
                                where three Related Posts are displayed, together with their
                                matching score (between 0 and 1). Explain that this feature involves
                                only MongoDB Vector Search, executed on-the-fly at display time. No
                                LLM required. Further elaborate on the fact that usually these
                                Related Posts are hardcoded by the editor of the article at writing
                                time. Now, with this approach, content is selected dynamically: When
                                looking at older articles, they can automatically be linked to newer
                                related content.

                            <li>
                                <strong>Personalization of the Home Page</strong>: Click on one or
                                two articles of similar topic (ideally combining this with Hybrid
                                Search, then the job is easier) and then click back to the Home
                                page. The history of the previously read articles is used to show
                                related articles on the Home page, rather than just sorting by
                                newest. Explain that this feature involves a MongoDB Vector Search
                                that is conducted on-the-fly under the hood every time the Home page
                                is accessed. Argue that this is only possible with a good performing
                                search functionality like the one that MongoDB provides.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Meta Data Calculation (Sections / Keywords / Sentiment /
                                Popularity)</strong>: Click on an article. At the top of the right
                                column there is a list of 5-6 keywords displayed.
                                Explain that they
                                have been calculated with the help of an LLM, and then added to the
                                JSON Document, leveraging the <a class="tm-color-primary"
                                href="#documentmodel">flexibility of the MongoDB Document
                                Model</a>. You can click on a keyword to fetch background
                                information about the item (again leveraging the power of GenAI).
                                <div style="padding: 0; margin: 0.5em"></div>
                                In a similar way, sentiment of the article (positive,
                                negative, neutral) is calculated, and displayed in smiley format.
                                Furthermore, up to three sections are auto-generated
                                for each article, and stored in MongoDB as a JSON list. Another
                                opportunity for you to emphasize the power of the document model,
                                allowing for list structures.
                                <div style="padding: 0; margin: 0.5em"></div>
                                Finally, popularity of the article is tracked by counting the page
                                impressions, as well as the qualified reads (user scrolls to the end
                                of the article, and stays on the page for longer than 10
                                seconds). This data will be used for dynamic pricing in a later
                                version of the demo.

                                Click on an article. At the top of the article's text, you find
                                links to create a summary and to translate to various languages,
                                available from the dropdown list. Explain that these manipulations
                                are done on-the-fly with the help of an LLM.

                                summarization of all the recent news, which is generated with the
                                help of an LLM. Close to midnight each working day, the summary is
                                sent by E-Mail as well. <a class="tm-color-primary"

                        News articles are ingested from RSS feeds every 60 minutes during business
                        hours, content is cleansed (removal of HTML Tags, Ads, Javascript, CSS, ...)
                        and enriched (creation of Main Image) with the help of OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
                        and Dall-E 3, and embeddings are calculated for Semantic Search and RAG.

                        A number of Content Services are then using the article data stored in

                        content can be consumed in several formats &ndash; text, audio/podcast.
