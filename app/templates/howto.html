			How to use the demo			
		    </h2>
                    <p>
			There are several paths you can follow to
			conduct your demo. Combine them as you see fit
			for your meeting with the customer, aligning
			to their requirements:
                    </p>
		    <p><ul>
			    <li>
				<strong>Hybrid Search</strong>: Use
			        the form at the top of the Home or
			        Single Post page to enter what you are
			        interested about. It can be
			        keyword-based ("Apple AI"), or a full
			        phrase ("what are the recent notable
			        events around Lucid Group"). In the
			        search results, you find some meta
			        information below each item. It is the
			        individual scores of the Full Text and
			        Vector searches, as well as the Time
			        Decay factor (the older the article,
			        the lower the number). Explain to your
			        customer how easily developers can
			        implement such a sophisticated
			        parallel search. You can
			        use <a class="tm-color-primary"
			        href="#hybridsearch">this picture</a>
			        for more technical audiences.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				<strong>Content Suggestions / Related
			        Posts</strong>: Click on a news
			        article on the Home page. Show the
			        right column of the page, where three
			        Related Posts are displayed, together
			        with their matching score (between 0
			        and 1). Explain that this feature
			        involves only MongoDB Vector Search,
			        executed on-the-fly at display
			        time. No LLM required. Further
			        elaborate on the fact that usually
			        these Related Posts are hardcoded by
			        the editor of the article at writing
			        time. Now, with this approach, content
			        is selected dynamically: When looking
			        at older articles, they can
			        automatically be linked to newer
			        related content.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				<strong>Personalization of the Home
			        Page</strong>: Click on one or two
			        articles of similar topic (ideally
			        combining this with Hybrid Search,
			        then the job is easier) and then click
			        back to the Home page. The history of
			        the previously read articles is used
			        to show related articles on the Home
			        page, rather than just sorting by
			        newest. Explain that this feature
			        involves a MongoDB Vector Search that
			        is conducted on-the-fly under the hood
			        every time the Home page is
			        accessed. Argue that this is only
			        possible with a good performing search
			        functionality like the one that
			        MongoDB provides.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				<strong>Meta Data Calculation
				(Keywords / Sentiment /
				Popularity)</strong>: Click on an
				article. At the top of the right
				column there is a list of 5-6 keywords
				displayed. Explain that they have been
				calculated with the help of an LLM,
				and then added to the JSON Document,
				leveraging
				the <a class="tm-color-primary"
				href="#documentmodel">flexibility of
				the MongoDB Document Model</a>. You
				can click on a keyword to fetch
				background information about the item
				(again leveraging the power of GenAI).
				In a similar way, sentiment of the
				article (positive, negative, neutral)
				is calculated, and displayed in smiley
				format. Finally, popularity of the
				article is tracked by counting the
				page impressions, as well as the
				qualified reads (user scrolls to the
				end of the article, and stays on the
				page for longer than 10 seconds). This
				data will be used for dynamic pricing
				in a later version of the demo.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				<strong>Content Manipulations (Summary
			        / Translation)</strong>: Click on an
			        article. At the top of the article's
			        text, you find links to Create Summary
			        and to Translate to various languages,
			        available from the dropdown
			        list. Explain that these manipulations
			        are done on-the-fly with the help of
			        an LLM.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				<strong>Summarization / Multimodal &
			        Multichannel Content</strong>: On the
			        left main navigation, click to Daily
			        Summary. You will see a summarization
			        of all the recent news, which is
			        generated with the help of an
			        LLM. Close to midnight each working
			        day, the summary is sent by E-Mail as
			        well. <a class="tm-color-primary"
			        href="mailto:benjamin.lorenz@mongodb.com">Let
			        me know</a> if you want to receive
			        these emails and I can add you to the
			        list. Furthermore, creation of
			        multimodal content is demonstrated: At
			        the top of the content area, you can
			        start a podcast version of the
			        summary. NotebookLM from Google is
			        used for this feature. The podcasts
			        for every workday
			        are <a class="tm-color-primary"
			        href="#podcast">uploaded to Apple</a>,
			        so you can also point your
			        customer <a class="tm-color-primary"
			        href="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/ist-daily-news/id1797795255">
			        to that channel</a> for listening in.
			    </li>
			    <li>
				<strong>Search Generative Experiences
				(SGE)</strong>: Click to the Insights
				page in the main navigtion on the
				left. Use the "Ask Question" form at
				the top of the page to formulate a
				question about any news-related
				topic. Using
				a <a class="tm-color-primary"
				href="#ragarchitecture">RAG
				Architecture</a> an informed answer to
				the question is formulated.
