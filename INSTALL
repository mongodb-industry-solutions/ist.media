For NetBSD 10.1 production server with pkgsrc-2025Q1,
you must link the following pkgsrc packages from
the global installation into your virtual environment,
otherwise `pip install -r requirements.txtÂ´ will fail,
due to incompatibilities of a few packages:

/usr/pkg/lib/python3.11/site-packages/zstandard
/usr/pkg/lib/python3.11/site-packages/zstandard-0.23.0.dist-info
/usr/pkg/lib/python3.11/site-packages/uWSGI-2.0.28.dist-info
